This is my personal website. It is currently quite doesn't include much of a content. However, the technologies used are:

- Deno
- Typescript
- Firebase hosting and Cloud Run
- CI/CD via Github Actions (with [`GCP_SA_KEY`](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys) as the only secret)

#### TODOs

- Find a way around getting `deno bundle` to work with a react app
- Report/fix `denon` not delegating argument `--allow-env` to `deno` cmd
- Report/fix issue: Deno.fmt doesn't remove unnecessary parentheses, like in `const x = (y);`
- Report/fix issue in response content from https://deno.land/std/http/server.ts, wrongly encoding emoji chars like "ðŸ¦•"
